#Twitter Service

Current purpose of this repository is playground for me. I try combine couple of frameworks and technology. How they play well together. Later I might add some other services.

Current feature is open stream of tweets based on keyword filter a and subscribe system output subscriber for this stream.

Technologies:
Gradle
Scala
Spring Boot
Akka
Reaktive Streams


TODO
* add tests
** collisions in mockito and scala test matchers
* register stream for keyword api (router feature, test cluster support), api might be also queue
* some queue subscriber
* final build as docker image
